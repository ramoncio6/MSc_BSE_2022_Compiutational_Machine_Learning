-Two extended projects using different machine learning models: both use a medical database from Kaggle that records patients traits. 
<br />
-The fist project implements K-Nearest Neighbours and Support Vector Machine in order to predict the probability of survival. 
<br />
-The second project implements Decision Trees, Random Forest, Ensemble and Neural Network medels in order to predict the lenght of stay for each patient.
